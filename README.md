### ğŸ‘‹ Hey there friends!

I am a Senior Developer Advocate for [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) and Board Chair of [Minnestar](https://minnestar.org). I'm a community builder at :yellow_heart:&ensp;and am passionate about making space for more underrepresented folks in tech and entrepreneurship to come as their full selves.

I go by she/her pronouns.
